Code written in this way is referred to a \"parallel\" code.\n","\n","Only some problems are amenable to parallel computing and the degree of speed-up depends on the nubmer of cores available. In addition, writing parallel programs can be complex and require a lot of skill and knowledge. However, the gains to be made here are very large and so this learning process can be worth the time required.\n","\n","This notebook does not intend to give you a working knowledge of how to implement parallel algorithms in Python but instead to give an example to demonstrate the power of the method.\n","\n","## Monte Carlo Calculation of $\\pi$\n","\n","Monte Carlo calcualtions rely on performing the same procedure repesteadly using one or more random numbers to cause the repetitions to produce different results. The ensemble of results can then be analysed to calculate a value of interest.\n","\n","A classic example of this is finding the value of $\\pi$. This is done by randomly generating pairs of values for $x$ and $y$ coordiinates between 0 and 1. By finding their distance from the origin it can be found if each point is inside a circle with radius 1. For each point inside the circle, 1 is added to a tally. When this tally is multiplied by 4 and then divided by the total number of points, an estimate of $\\pi$ can be found. The more points which are sampled the more accurate the estimate. A video desribing this algorithm can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELetCV_wX_c).\n","\n","In the first code cell below we implement this algorithm in serial (non-parallel) Python. in the second cell, we use the [joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parallel.html) package to implement a parallel implementation."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{},"colab_type":"code","id":"2MCvADbSI-9h"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["3.143328\n"]},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Timer unit: 1e-07 s\n","\n","Total time: 1.73277 s\n","File: C:\\Users\\jacob\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ipykernel_20900\\4212319410.py\n","Function: calculate_pi at line 4\n","\n","Line #      Hits         Time  Per Hit   % Time  Line Contents\n","==============================================================\n","     4                                           def calculate_pi(n):\n","     5                                             #Calcualte pi by smapling n points in 2D space and seeing if they fall inside a circle with radius 1\n","     6         1          4.0      4.0      0.0    tally=0\n","     7   1000000    3213363.0      3.2     18.5    for i in range(n):\n","     8                                               # Loop over n points, creating values of x and y for each\n","     9   1000000    3470619.0      3.5     20.0      x = random.random()\n","    10   1000000    3218864.0      3.2     18.6      y = random.random()\n","    11    785832    4881207.0      6.2     28.2      if x ** 2 + y ** 2 < 1:\n","    12                                                 # If the sum of the squares of x and y are less than 1, the point is within a circle with radius 1, so increasing tally\n","    13    785832    2543655.0      3.2     14.7        tally = tally + 1\n","    14                                           \n","    15                                             # Our estimate of pi is equal to 4*tally/n\n","    16         1         13.0     13.0      0.0    return (4 * tally / n)"]}],"source":[" \n","\n","%load_ext line_profiler\n","import random\n","\n","def calculate_pi(n):\n","  #Calcualte pi by smapling n points in 2D space and seeing if they fall inside a circle with radius 1\n","  tally=0\n","  for i in range(n):\n","    # Loop over n points, creating values of x and y for each\n","    x = random.random()\n","    y = random.random()\n","    if x ** 2 + y ** 2 < 1:\n","      # If the sum of the squares of x and y are less than 1, the point is within a circle with radius 1, so increasing tally\n","      tally = tally + 1\n","\n","  # Our estimate of pi is equal to 4*tally/n\n","  return (4 * tally / n)\n","\n","%lprun -f calculate_pi print(calculate_pi(1000000))"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"colab":{},"colab_type":"code","id":"1I8kqAFhPoHz"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["The line_profiler extension is already loaded.
